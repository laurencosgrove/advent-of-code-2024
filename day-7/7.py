# Part 1
# Each line represents a single equation. 
# The test value appears before the colon on each line; 
# it is your job to determine whether the remaining numbers can be combined with operators to produce the test value.
# Operators are always evaluated left-to-right, not according to precedence rules. 
# Furthermore, numbers in the equations cannot be rearranged. 
# Only two different types of operators: add (+) and multiply (*).
# Return the sum of the test values from just the equations that could possibly be true.

# Part 2
# The concatenation operator (||) combines the digits from its left and right inputs into a single number. 
# For example, 12 || 345 would become 12345. All operators are still evaluated left-to-right.
#Â Add this operator and again return the sum of the test values from the equations that could possibly be true.
